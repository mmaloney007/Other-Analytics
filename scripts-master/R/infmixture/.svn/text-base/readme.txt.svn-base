Code for running the infinite multi-view sampler presented in NIPS'08
workshop paper: Simon Rogers, Janne Sinkkonen, Arto Klami, Mark
Girolami, and Samuel Kaski. Two-level infinite mixture for
multi-domain data.

A more complete description can be found in the ML09-submission
located in mi/papers/ml09/.


gibbs_dep_infall_marg_tables.m has the actual code, whereas
run_gibbs_dep_inf.m contains one example of how it can be run and
interpreted on toy data.

The code has been written by Simon Rogers, but contact Arto if you
want to know more. The code is almost completely undocumented.
